Our SQLintersection Fall 2018 line-up is packed with nine full-day workshops over 3 days (2 preconference days and 1 post-conference day) as well as over 40 technology-focused (NOT marketing) sessions from which to choose. You’ll learn proven problem-solving techniques and technologies you can implement immediately as well as learn about the future of SQL Server. Our primary conference focus is around performance monitoring, troubleshooting, designing for scale and performance, cloud, as well as new features in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017. It’s time to determine your migration strategy and this is the place to figure out how best to do that with the smallest impact and biggest gains! 

And, unlike some other conferences, SQLintersection speakers are all real-world consultants, members of the Microsoft product development or Microsoft customer service / support teams who are also known as the best speakers in the SQL Server community! If you want practical development from REAL experts, this is the place to be!
