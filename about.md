Our Spring 2019, SQLintersection line-up is packed with eight, full-day workshops over 3 days (2 preconference days and 1 post-conference day) as well as tons of technology-focused (NOT marketing) sessions by top speakers. You’ll learn proven problem-solving techniques and technologies you can implement immediately as well as learn about the future of SQL Server. Our primary conference focus is around performance monitoring, troubleshooting, designing for scale and performance, cloud, as well as migrating to SQL Server 2019 and how to leverage key new features in SQL Server 2017 and higher! It’s time to determine your migration strategy and this is the place to figure out how best to do that with the smallest impact and biggest gains!

And, unlike some other conferences, SQLintersection speakers are all real-world consultants, members of the Microsoft product development or Microsoft customer service / support teams who are also known as the best speakers in the SQL Server community! If you want practical development from REAL experts who can really teach you HOW to do things RIGHT, this is the place to be!
