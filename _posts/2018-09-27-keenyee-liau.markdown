My name is Keen, and I graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in aerospace engineering. However, my passion in programming led me to a career with a startup in Houston and a financial company in NYC. I joined the Angular/Typescript team at Google in 2017 and I've been primarily working on the Angular language service, Angular server-side rendering, and the Karma test runner. My experience with Javascript is mostly in backend infrastructure, Node.js, and code bundling.
