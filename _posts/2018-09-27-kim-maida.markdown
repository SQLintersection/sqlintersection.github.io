I'm a seasoned Angular developer and consultant, now working as the Manager of Technical Content & Community for Auth0, writing in-depth technical tutorials on Angular and a variety of other technologies while leading the team of technical writer engineers producing content for Auth0's technical blog and website. I'm passionate about security, authentication, the Angular community, and I love learning and sharing with other developers. I also enjoy running Angular authentication workshops and I mentor ngGirls workshops whenever possible.
